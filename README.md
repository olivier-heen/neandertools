# neandertools
Old-school tools to ease manipulation of network data in scripts.

The tools are filters meant to be piped. They work both ways simultaneosly. They transform the lines containing one input. They do not transform the other lines.

Use for manual manipulation and simple scripting. Do not use for automated processinc with possibly adversarial input.
