# tamp.py can merge lists and intervals is some cases. For example the lines below will turn to 1-42 after two iterations of tamp.py.

1
2-4
5
6-16
17-32
33
34-41
42

# Yet, tamp.py can not merge systematically, as long as options --maxi and --mini are not developped. For example, the lines below do not merge, whatever the number of iterations.

1
2
3
4
5-8
