# tamp.py can be involutive

Since tam.py converts lists to intervals, and intervals to lists, there can be some invlutive case. That is, applying tamp.py twice does not change the file. Example: diff <(./tamp.py ./test/tamp.test.03 | ./tamp.py) ./test/tamp.test.03

This case happen under some conditions: no negative number involved, no reverse interval, item that can merge are separated.
